Custom DEBIAN scripts for making deb packages and adding them to repos

I have noticed over the past few years that documentation for Debian customization and development has been hard to find, or easy to find and written poorly. This repository will hold the documentatation to help anyone interested in developing for the DEBIAN package manager, APT. 

If you are interested in developing your own distruction based off of DEBIAN and came up short of good documentation, please check my custom DEBIAN ISO Scripts repository for more information.
